# Presitas3D WebApp

## Overview
An innovative solution powered by deep learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), enabling you to quickly and accurately analyze 3D digital rocks. With advanced algorithms, our platform estimates key rock properties, including porosity, specific surface area, average grain size, coordination number, and throat radius.

This application is an advanced development of our research titled [A Study of Transfer Learning in Digital Rock Properties Measurement](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/acf117/meta)


## Requirements:
- Python 3.9.21
- All Python Library in requirements.txt


## Usage
Once the development server is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the application. Upload your 3D Digital Rock in a `.mat` file.
